# br_controls by jaranvil

This is a program made by jaranvil, that controls the reactors from the mod Extreme reactors.
Due that he is no longer maintaining it, and i still use it to this day I fixed some of the issues:

- RF is now FE
- Storage was displaying not the correct energy stored. apperently the buffer has changed for Extreme reactors 2.


What do you need:
- CC:Tweaked
- Minecraft 1.16 or higher.
